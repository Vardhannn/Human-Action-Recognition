# 🧠 Human Action Recognition using Custom CNN

This is a deep learning project focused on **Human Action Recognition (HAR)** in videos using a custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained on the **UCF101 dataset**, which consists of 101 different human action classes.

The project uses **TensorFlow** to build and train the model and achieves an impressive **97.5% accuracy** on the test set.
